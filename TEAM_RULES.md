# Team Ground Rules

## Our attitude and culture
 - We will treat each other with respect and professionalism at all times.
 - We will maintain open and honest communication to build trust.
 - We will give feedback in a constructive way and avoid being defensive.
 - We will recognize and celebrate individual and team progress.

## Team meetings
 - We will meet at the very least once every week.
 - All members are expected to attend unless they are sick, on vacation, or have another valid excuse.
 - Meetings will start on time, and all members are expected to be prepared.

## Communication and decision-making
 - Only one person speaks at a time; side conversations are avoided.
 - All communication will be clear, transparent, and respectful.
 - We will listen with an open mind before decisions are made.
 - Every team member will have a chance to participate.
 - Decisions will be made together, and once a decision is made, we all support it.
